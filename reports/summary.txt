Suggestions for improvement:
- **tournaments/services.py**: Add tests for match disputing, prize payment, refunds, and winner submission services.
- **wallet/views.py**: Add tests for the `WithdrawalRequestAPIView` and `AdminWithdrawalRequestViewSet`, covering creation, approval, and rejection of withdrawal requests.
- **users/services.py**: Add more edge cases for team management, such as trying to remove a non-existent member or responding to an invalid invitation.
