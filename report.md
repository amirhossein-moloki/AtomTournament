# Technical Audit Report

This report outlines the findings of a technical audit of the tournament project.

## Summary of Findings

The project exhibits several significant flaws in its structure, documentation, and code quality. While some refactoring has been done, the project is not in a satisfactory state. The test suite is inadequate and provides a false sense of security. The documentation is outdated and misleading.

## Specific Issues

1.  **Committed Artifacts:** The repository contains committed artifacts, including `.env` files, `db.sqlite3`, `__pycache__` directories, and `*.pyc` files. This is a security risk and a violation of best practices. These files have been removed from the git index.
2.  **Outdated and Inaccurate Documentation:** The `reports.md` file was outdated and contained misleading information. It has been deleted. The `report.md` file contained inaccurate claims about the state of the project, which have been corrected.
3.  **Inadequate Test Coverage:** The test suite is not comprehensive and contains several flaws.
    *   The tests primarily focus on the happy path and do not cover edge cases or failure scenarios.
    *   A test in `tournaments/tests.py` was a placeholder with no assertions and has been removed.
    *   Tests in `users/tests.py` contained incorrect assertions and have been fixed.
4.  **Model Design Flaws:**
    *   The `InGameID` model in the `users` app has a nullable `ForeignKey` to `User`, which can lead to data integrity issues.
    *   The `Match` model in the `tournaments` app uses multiple nullable `ForeignKey` fields to represent participants, which is a complex and error-prone design.
5.  **Security Concerns:**
    *   The `result_proof` field in the `Match` model uploads files to a "private" directory, but there is no evidence of access control, which could expose sensitive information.

## Conclusion

The project requires significant work to meet enterprise-grade standards. The issues identified in this report should be addressed to improve the project's quality, security, and maintainability.
